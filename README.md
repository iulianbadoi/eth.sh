# eth.sh
## Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Ethereum + ethminer setup script for Nvidia GPUs

### New in version 1.1

- script now activates auto-login with immediate screensaver lock. This facilitates automated miner startup
  as long as computer has power and secure unattended reboots directly to locked desktop.  
- if -w <wallet_address> option is used upon install miner will automatically launch upon startup behind locked
  screensaver at any reboot, powerup. [ request from user krtschmr ]. Miner automatically reboots every 24 hours
  and resumes. 15 minutes per 24 hours is donated time.
- Default pool used is dwarfpool https://dwarfpool.com/eth [ not changeable for now, sorry ]  
- Nvidia 381 driver is now default  
- fixed bug parsing multiple GPU indexes [ thanks to user teflon16 for finding this bug ]
  not sure if the bug is actually fixed, I only have one GPU to test on, waiting on feedback
- special thanks to user luigi311 for code suggestions, working on integrating suggestions. 

# --------------------------------------------------------------------

- Written for Ubuntu 16.04 with a Desktop environment (Typical default install)
- Features automatic power reduction and overclocking of GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 GPUs
- Installs Nvidia driver if needed
- Configures nvidia cool-bits xorg config as needed for overclocking
- Installs latest ethminer with CUDA optimizations 
- Installs Ethereum package including geth
- Optionally installs CUDA 8.0 toolkit and sets correct PATH per Nvidia documentation
- Overclocking only option
- Now fully automated
- Will optionally donate 60 minutes of GPU time after install, only runs once

## USAGE

Typical usage for full automation. From Desktop open terminal and `cd` to directory with script. Your computer will restart and continue automatically as needed. If your computer is fast some reboots will happen before you even unlock the screen. This is normal.

On a default clean install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, this is typical usage:

`sudo chmod a+x eth.sh`

`sudo ./eth.sh -w 0xf1d9bb42932a0e770949ce6637a0d35e460816b5`

Options can be added as desired. For verbose mode with lots of output [ not recommended, for debugging ]:

`sudo ./eth.sh -w 0xf1d9bb42932a0e770949ce6637a0d35e460816b5 -v`

To reduce GPU power and overclock with installing anything: (may require reboot if cool-bits are not set)

`sudo ./eth.sh -o`

Other options include:

```-v       enable verbose mode, lots of output
-c       install CUDA 8.0 toolkit, not required for ethminer
-w       wallet address - this will activate full automation mode
-h       print this menu
-375     installs Nvidia 375 driver version rather than 381
-o       overclocking only
```
After the script is done installing all steps, it will launch automatically at boot (your account will automatically be logged in and the screen locked. When you log in you will see the miner working in a terminal window. This will make your computer run slow of course. To stop mining at anytime, run `top` or `ps` commands in a separate terminal with apropriate options to kill the ethminer process. 

If you are interested in overclocking only run ./eth.sh -o. Do not install the script. You should see output like the following:

```
sudo eth.sh -o
found 1 gpu[s]...
found GeForce GTX 1060 at index 0...
setting persistence mode...
Enabled persistence mode for GPU 0000:01:00.0.
All done.
setting power limit to 75 watts..
Power limit for GPU 0000:01:00.0 was set to 75.00 W from 120.00 W.
All done.
setting memory overclock of 500 Mhz...

  Attribute 'GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset' (riker-Z:0[gpu:0]) assigned value
  500.
  ```
